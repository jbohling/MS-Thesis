  abstract = {In low cycle fatigue at elevated temperature, the interaction between fatigue crack and creep damages is known to be responsible for the significant reduction of the fatigue life. In this investigation, a model for the life prediction for low cycle fatigue with hold time at tensile peak strain is suggested for the temperature range of 0.5T m. This model is formulated on the basis of the assumptions that the creep cavities are formed due to the vacancies generated during fatigue, and are grown during the hold period. The fatigue crack nucleated at the surface due to fatigue loading is affected by the creep damages for its propagation. The model is checked by experimental results with various hold time periods. The predicted creep-fatigue lives are in good agreement with experimentally observed ones for 304 stainless steel and 13CrMo44 steel.},

  abstract = {This article presents an overview of the developments in stainless steels made since the 1990s. Some of the new applications that involve the use of stainless steel are also introduced.

A brief introduction to the various classes of stainless steels, their precipitate phases and the status quo of their production around the globe is given first. The advances in a variety of subject areas that have been made recently will then be presented. These recent advances include (1) new findings on the various precipitate phases (the new J phase, new orientation relationships, new phase diagram for the Fe–Cr system, etc.); (2) new suggestions for the prevention/mitigation of the different problems and new methods for their detection/measurement and (3) new techniques for surface/bulk property enhancement (such as laser shot peening, grain boundary engineering and grain refinement). Recent developments in topics like phase prediction, stacking fault energy, superplasticity, metadynamic recrystallisation and the calculation of mechanical properties are introduced, too. In the end of this article, several new applications that involve the use of stainless steels are presented. Some of these are the use of austenitic stainless steels for signature authentication (magnetic recording), the utilisation of the cryogenic magnetic transition of the sigma phase for hot spot detection (the Sigmaplugs), the new Pt-enhanced radiopaque stainless steel (PERSS) coronary stents and stainless steel stents that may be used for magnetic drug targeting.

Besides recent developments in conventional stainless steels, those in the high-nitrogen, low-Ni (or Ni-free) varieties are also introduced. These recent developments include new methods for attaining very high nitrogen contents, new guidelines for alloy design, the merits/demerits associated with high nitrogen contents, etc.},

  abstract = {Grain boundary segregation is often considered to play a role in the various types of intergranular failures observed in austenitic alloys. However, there has been little direct study of this segregation because it is usually very difficult to obtain intergranular fracture in these alloys in the high vacuum required for surface analysis. This paper reports an Auger electron spectroscopy study of grain boundary segregation in the nickel-base Alloy 182. This alloy was used because it would easily fracture along its grain boundaries in high vacuum and because it has a very complex microstructure, as do many nickel-base alloys used in engineering applications. Furthermore, the alloy is widely used as a weld filler metal to join nickel-base alloys to one another or to stainless steels. Phosphorus was found to be the only impurity element that segregated to the grain boundaries. There was considerable variability in segregation from grain boundary to grain boundary and also on a single grain facet. It is suggested that these variations arise primarily from variations in grain boundary structure, in the density and types of precipitates in a grain boundary, and in the consequent variety of precipitate matrix interfaces present at the grain boundary. It is also suggested that quantitative Auger analysis on such a material would be very difficult.},

been related to the loss of ductility due to the formation of carbides and other compounds, such as nickel silicide. The hot ductility behavior of three service-aged,
heat-resistant stainless steel castings, HP-45Nb, HP-50Nb, and 20-32Nb, were studied using the Gleeble® thermomechanical simulator. Results from hot ductility
testing are presented and detailed fractographic analysis of samples tested at 900°
and 1100°C is described. During the simulated cooling cycle, the HP-Nb modified
alloy demonstrated significantly higher ductility as compared to the 20-32Nb alloy.
The differences in high-temperature stability of the preexisting embrittling constituents in these alloys resulted in different microstructure evolution that influenced their hot ductility behavior. Based on the results, the service-exposed HP-Nb
modified alloy is considered to have acceptable repair weldability. In contrast, the
service-exposed 20-32Nb alloys showed severe susceptibility to liquation cracking
and significant loss in on-cooling ductility, and are considered difficult to repair unless a high-temperature solution annealing heat treatment is performed.},

Microstructural analyses were performed by optical metallography, fractography, electron microprobe analysis, and analytical electron microscopy on specimens that were water quenched from selected temperatures during this thermal cycle. Analysis of analytical electron microscopy (AEM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) data suggests that incipient melting of the grain boundaries occurs at temperatures of 1300 °C and above. The HAZ hot-cracking mechanism was consistent with aspects of a constitutional liquation phenomenon involving a nonequilibrium eutectic-type reaction between grain boundary Ti(C, N) and the austenitic matrix. The extent of expected HAZ cracking would be low as the liquation of Ti(C, N) was localized and no lower melting intermetallic solidification products(e.g., Laves) were observed. The mechanistic observations were consistent with classical thermodynamic and solid state diffusion models.},

Furthermore, the addition of Nb to existing steels such as ferritic stainless steels has also led to improvement. The goal of this paper is to review the basic behavior of niobium in a wide range of steels, including both the traditional steels and also some of the newer versions. Particular emphasis has been placed on the basic metallurgical principles that apply to these steels, for it is the application of these principles that allows the composition - processing - microstructure mechanical property relationships to be rationalized and exploited. The application of basic metallurgical principles has resulted in a predictive capability that has led to alterations in composition and processing for the purpose of producing steels with superior mechanical properties and improved overall performance.},

  abstract = {The two principal roles of niobium in cast and wrought austenitic stainless steels are as a stabilizing agent to reduce the risk of intergranular corrosion and as a strengthening agent. To date there appears to be no parallel roles in the duplex, austenitic-ferritic stainless steels. The principles for designing an austenitic steel composition are outlined and the effects of niobium as an alloying element summarized. The characteristics of the principal precipitate phases and their occurrence are reviewed in the context of service requirements, to illustrate how compositions have evolved. Metallurgical developments covered include the benefits derived from a balanced reduction in the levels of niobium and carbon in the 347 composition. Application of controlled heat treatments combined with cold working has allowed optimization of both steam-side oxidation and creep strength for this widely used grade. The combination of low levels of niobium with enhanced nitrogen additions has led to alternative stabilization mechanisms. Enhanced precipitation strengthening for high temperature applications derives from multiple microalloying additions of, principally, niobium, titanium and vanadium and recognition of the role of the chromium-niobium nitride. Families of high strength creep resisting steels have been developed for both fossil and nuclear power generation applications, based on the synergistic effects of multiple alloying additions of molybdenum, niobium, titanium, nitrogen, copper and tungsten. These steels exploit knowledge of alloy design to combine effective solid solution and precipitation strengthening with optimum grain boundary precipitation.},

It is only some seventy years ago that the stainless steels were discovered, more or less accidently by Brearley i n England, and Strauss and Maurer i n Germany (5), Brearley being responsible for the 13 percent Cr martensitic cutlery steels whilst Strauss and Maurer discovered the austenitic 20 percent C r , 7 percent N i alloys. Both discoveries were made in a search for quite different types of material, but it is significant that both alloys contained more than 12 percent Cr which is the critical level for corrosion and oxidation resistance. Thus both alloys displayed what was to become universally accepted as the property of "stainless".},

  title = {Fundamental metallurgy of niobium in steel},
  abstract = {In the early 1960's, the forerunners of the current microalloyed steels were being studied and fairly well understood, (1- 4) and the first conference devoted to these materials was held in Harrogate, England, in 1963 (5). The present paper reviews some of the metallurgical developments which have taken place since then in the alloy design, processing and application of these steels. Particular emphasis has been placed on the basic metallurgical principles which apply to these steels, for it is the application of these principles which allows the composition - processing – microstructure mechanical property relationships to be rationalized and exploited. The application of basic metallurgical principles has resulted in a predictive capability which has lead to alterations in composition and processing for the purpose of producing steels with superior mechanical properties and improved overall performance.},

The atomic proportions of the stabilizing elements and the interstitials (C and N) were kept constant. It was found that when two stabilizing elements were added, both of these were present in the MX precipitates. Substantial amounts of Cr dissolved in the MX precipitates. This effect was greater for nitrides (which were all V rich) than for carbides and led to a higher solubility for the nitrides which consequently coarsened faster during high-temperature aging. The coarsening behaviours of TiC and NbC were complicated by the fact that TiC partially transformed to M23C6 at long aging times while, in the Nb-stabilized alloy, M23C6 transformed to NbC. It is concluded that Nb is a considerably more effective stabilizing addition than Ti.},

  abstract = {The thermal effect causing a sensibility of stainless steels to the intercrystalline corrosionis accompanied by the precipitation of mixed carbides rich in chromium on the grain boundaries. In spite of various views of the mechanism of the intercrystalline corrosion it is possible to prove by the theory of depletion the relationship between the intercrystalline corrosion and the precipitation of carbides of chromium. At low temperatures the position of the Rollanson-curve corresponds to the curve of precipitation of carbides of Me23C6.
The sensibility to the intercrystalline corrosion cannot only be associated with the two-dimensional particles, but also with the carbides developed crystallographically and their distribution. These carbides are very numerous at all the temperatures and times of precipitation corresponding to a strong intercrystalline corrosion.
The creation of continuous chromium depletion in the neighbourhood of the carbides was found to be undoubtedly the primary cause of intercrystalline attacks. It is indicated that studies of the subject relation are most conveniently made with the aid of extraction replicas or possibly thin metal foils as specimens for electron microscopy.
L'effet thermique qui est la cause de la sensibilité des aciers inoxydables à la corrosionintercristalline est accompagné de la précipitation de carbures mixtes riches en chrome sur les régions limitrophes du grain. En dépit de points de vue divers du mécanisme de la corrosion intercristalline, il est possible de prouver par la théorie d'amoindrissement la relation entre la corrosion intercristalline et la précipitation de carbures de chrome. A basses températures la position de la courbe de Rollanson correspond à la courbe de précipitation de carbures de Me23C6.
La sensibilité à la corrosion intercristalline ne peut seulement être associée aux particules bi-dimensionellesmais aussi aux carbures développés cristallographiquement et leur distribution. Ces carbures sont très nombreux à toutes les températures et temps de précipitation correspondant à une forte corrosion intercristalline.
La création d'un abaissement continuel de chrome dans le voisinage des carbures a été trouvéeêtre sans aucun doute la cause principale d'attaques intercristallines. Il est indiqué l'étude de la relation du sujet est le mieux menée à l'aide de reproductions d'extraction ou encore à l'aide de pellicules métalliques minces comme échantillons pour la microscopic par électrons.
Die Wärmewirkung, welche eine Sensibilität von rostfreiem Stahl für interkristalline Korrosion verursacht, wird von der Ausscheidung gemischter, an Chrom reichen Kohlenstoffmetalle an den Korngrenzen begleitet. Trotz der verschiedenen Ansichten über die Arbeitsweise interkristalliner Korrosion ist es möglich, durch die Theorie der Abreicherung die Beziehung zwischen der interkristallinen Korrosion und der Ausscheidung von Chromkohlenstoffmetallen zu beweisen. Bei niedrigen Temperaturen entspricht die Lage der Rollanson Kurve der Ausscheidungskurve von Kohlenstoffmetallen des Me23C6.
Die Sensibilität der interkristallinen Korrosion kann nicht nur mit den zwei-dimensionalen Partikeln verbunden werden, sondern auch mit den kristallographisch entwickelten Kohlenstoffmetallen und ihrer Verteilung. Diese Kohlenstoffmetalle sind bei allen Temperaturen und zu allen Zeiten der Ausscheidung sehr zahlreich, entsprechend einer starken, interkristallinen Korrosion.
Die Bildung ständiger Chromabreicherung nahe den Kohlenstoffmetallen fand man zweifellos als den Hauptgrund für interkristallinen Angriff. Es wird darauf hingewiesen, dass Untersuchungen der gegenständlichen Beziehung am besten mit Hilfe von Extraktionsnachbildungen oder möglicherweise dünnen Metallfolien als Probe für Elektronenmikroskopie gemacht werden.},

The chromium composition profiles in high angle grain boundaries were found to be similar both in the vicinity of intergranular M23C6 carbides and at boundary segments between them, i.e. the whole grain boundary area acted as a collector plate to supply the growing M23C6 with chromium. Cr-depleted zones did not develop at coherent twin boundaries in the same way as at ordinary high angle boundaries. No major difference in the width or depth of the depleted zones was observed for the niobium and titanium stabilized alloys except for a weak persistence at 100 h in the niobium containing alloy. The error function solution of Fick's second law for diffusion was found to give a good approximation of the depleted zones in the early stages of ageing.},

Coupons with 1.5-mm thickness were water quenched on a GLEEBLE thermomechanical simulator at various instances during the heating portion of a welding thermal cycle. Particle dissolution kinetics data were obtained by statistical analysis of digital images of resulting microstructure. For most of the test alloys, a good correlation exists between the dissolution kinetics and the susceptibility to cracking in the HAZ. The faster the Nb-carbide particles dissolve, the more resistant the alloy is to constitutional liquation cracking. The rate at which particles dissolve seems to be affected by their stoichiometry. If Nb:C ratios in bulk alloys are closer to the ideal stoichiometry of 7.7, NbC particles formed in the alloy are more likely to be stable and, hence, slower to dissolve.},

The present paper is addressed to a correlation of the observed creep behaviour with the microstructural developments caused by the ageing treatments and the subsequent thermal exposure to 1023 K during creep testing. In the present alloy, NbC is unusually unstable with respect to G-phase (Ni16Nb6Si7), with the latter forming more rapidly and at higher temperature than in other comparable materials in the absence of irradiation. Consideration is given to the reasons for this. It is shown that the G-phase particles, in contrast to those of NbC, are deformable at the 1023 K creep testing temperature. The creep behaviour is interpreted in terms of this observation, together with those of the progress of the NbC to G-phase transformation with ageing/creep, and the particle distributions thereby produced.[/p]},

The components are typically made of wrought Alloy 800, 800H or 800HT or similar cast 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb alloys. The welds are made using filler metals or electrodes of similar compositions or high-nickel alloy compositions. Creep-rupture data that have been developed for weld metals are reviewed and compared. Problems that have been encountered with failures of welds in this application are discussed. The current recommended materials for welding these manifolds are outlined.},

Short-term creep rupture strength was found to increase with the addition of copper in the 347 steel, but the long-term strength was inferior. Extensive creep cavitation deprived the steel of the beneficial effect of creep deformation resistance induced by nano-size copper particles. Boron and cerium additions in the copper-containing steel increased its creep rupture strength and ductility, which were more for higher boron content. Creep deformation, grain boundary sliding, and creep cavity nucleation and growth in the steel were found to be suppressed by microalloying the copper-containing steel with boron and cerium, and the suppression was more for higher boron content. An auger electron spectroscopic study revealed the segregation of boron instead of sulfur on the cavity surface of the boron- and cerium-microalloyed steel. Cerium acted as a scavenger for soluble sulfur in the steels through the precipitation of cerium sulfide (CeS). This inhibited the segregation of sulfur and facilitated the segregation of boron on cavity surface. Boron segregation on the nucleated cavity surface reduced its growth rate. Microalloying the copper-containing 347 steel with boron and cerium thus enabled to use the full extent of creep deformation resistance rendered by copper nano-size particle by increase in creep rupture strength and ductility.},

  volume = {87},
  issn = {0043-2296},
  abstract = {High-chromium (similar to 30 wt\%) nickel-alloy filler metals are desirable for use in nuclear power systems due to their outstanding resistance to corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. However, these alloys are susceptible to welding defects, especially to subsolidus intergranular cracking commonly known as ductility dip cracking (DDC). In order to develop a high-chromium filler metal that is resistant to as-welded defects, a series of Ni-Cr alloys between 16 wt-\% and 34 wt-\% chromium were assessed for their susceptibility to cracking. Each alloy was evaluated by fabricating a restrained, multipass, automatic gas tungsten arc, V-groove weld, and counting the number of cracks per unit area observable at 50x. The type of cracking (subsolidus DDC or solidification cracking) was further differentiated via scanning electron microscopy. The results from these welds, coupled with microstructural characterization, chemical analyses, mechanical testing, microstructural modeling, and finite element modeling indicate that DDC in Ni-Cr alloys is caused by the combination of macroscopic thermal and solidification stresses induced during welding and local grain boundary stresses generated during precipitation of partially coherent (Cr,Fe)(23)C-6 carbides. Cracking can be mitigated by alloying to minimize (Cr,Fe)(23)C-6 precipitation (e.g., by Nb and Ti additions), lessening the misfit between the matrix and these precipitates (lowering the Cr and Fe concentration), and by minimizing welding-induced stresses. This mechanism of precipitation-induced cracking (PIC) via misfit stresses is consistent with subsolidus cracking in other alloy systems including superalloys, nickel-copper alloys, titanium alloys, and ferritic steels where ductility loss corresponds to the time/temperature regime where partially coherent or fully coherent second phases form.},

  abstract = {Microstructural analysis of welded joints in pipes of a heat-resistant alloy was carried out. The samples that were studied were cut from pipes that were kept at 800 °C for 10 months in a gas heater used to heat up the gas used for the direct reduction of iron ore. This work is concentrated on the analysis of a series of cracks detected in the base metal and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of welded joints. It was found that such cracking was of intergranular nature and that the cracks propagated through the primary carbides. Two different types of carbides, which differed in silicon content, were detected. It was also observed that cracks propagated in a preferential way through the rich carbides. This analysis allows for the conclusion that the presence of silicon in the carbides increases the cracking susceptibility of the alloy.},

A complete description of the phases present in the as-cast, welded, and aged condition was made as a function of the modifying elements. The chromium carbide stoichiometry, secondary precipitation, NbC instability at elevated temperatures, the G-phase transformation, and the effect of Ti on this reaction are discussed.

  abstract = {The modified HK 40 heat resistant steel with higher chromium and silicon content has improved resistance to carburization and metal dusting but presents serious weldability problems as the material is fissured during the welding process. In order to know the microstructural factors that determine the weldability of the alloy, several welding repair tests were carried out and the causes that origin cracking during welding process were determined. The purpose of this study was to determine the phases that participate in the cracking and to analyze their effect on the weldability of the alloy.
Microanalysis of the aged metal, cracked during welding, showed that the eutectic carbides modified their composition regarding the as cast condition, diminishing the chromium content and increasing the iron, nickel, silicon, carbon and molybdenum contents. It was also detected inside the eutectic carbides the presence of phases rich in carbon, silicon, molybdenum and vanadium. These transformations should have enhanced the alloy susceptibility to cracking, particularly in the area of the eutectic carbides, and hence they increased the fragility and impaired the weldability properties of the alloy. The cracking observed was intergranular-type and spreads through the eutectic carbides. M23C6 carbides, austenite, nickel silicide (Ni31Si12) and sigma phase were found in the aged alloy by X-ray diffraction analysis.},

  abstract = {Superplastic forming (SPF) dies are generally made of using heat resistant cast steels, which are very sensitive to weld cracking. In order to improve the weld-repair process of such dies to prevent weld-cracking, the microstructure and the mechanical behaviour of a typical heat-resistant cast steel was first studied, using isothermal low-cycle fatigue tests and in situ tensile tests. The welding behaviour of such steel was also investigated, using a shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process and welding conditions similar to those employed for weld repair industrial dies. The comparison of the aspect of weld-cracking with the fracture mechanisms observed at room temperature or during isothermal low-cycle fatigue tests suggests a similar brittle failure mechanism, due to the presence of large interdendritic carbides in the cast steel. The melting of the cast steel surface using a gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process allowed to refine the primary carbides, and then to reduce the weld-cracking sensitivity. The refining method with GTAW before welding has been successfully tested to weld-repair a sample representative of SPF dies, and is recommended for subsequent repairs of such dies.},

The initial part of this investigation has focused on characterization of the microstructure of these alloys after service exposure times of up to 12 years. Microstructure evolution from the as-cast condition to the service-exposed condition is described. In the as-cast condition, both eutectic NbC and Cr-rich M7C3 carbides were observed in the HP–Nb alloys. In contrast, only eutectic NbC carbides were present in the as-cast 20–32Nb alloys due to a significantly higher atomic ratio of Nb/C as compared to the HP–Nb alloys. In the service-exposed condition, an Ni–Nb silicide and Cr-rich M23C6 were identified in both alloys. The HP–Nb alloys exhibited a much higher total volume fraction of microconstituents than the 20–32Nb alloys and the M23C6 phase was more prevalent than Ni–Nb silicide. In contrast, the Ni–Nb silicide was dominant in the service-exposed 20–32Nb alloys. This difference resulted in a significant increase in the repair welding liquation cracking susceptibility of the 20–32Nb service-exposed alloy.},

The results reveal that the eutectic carbides precipitated primarily at the dendrite and grain boundaries show various morphologies from the outer wall to the inner wall along radial direction of the cast tubes, consisting of the thin film-like carbides, the blocky carbides, the lamellar carbide clusters resembling the pearlite and the skeleton-like carbides. The initial solidification conditions have significant influences on the grain morphologies and the distribution of the eutectic carbides in the cast tubes. Increasing the cooling rate markedly promotes the development of the columnar grains and restrains the precipitation of the eutectic carbides, while an applied electromagnetic field during the centrifugal solidification induces a notable grain refining and a marked change of the precipitation zones of the eutectic carbides from the dendrite boundaries to the grain boundaries. The applied electromagnetic markedly improves the creep rupture strength of the centrifugal cast 25Cr20Ni heat-resistant steel tubes. The relationships between the initial solidification conditions and the solidification processes as well as the creep rupture strength were discussed at length.},

  abstract = {A centrifugally cast 20Cr32Ni1Nb stainless steel manifold in service for 16 years at temperatures ranging from 1073 K to 1123 K (800 °C to 850 °C) has been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nb(C,N), M23C6, and the silicide G-phases (Ni16Nb6Si7) were all identified in a conventional SEM, while the nitride Z-phase (CrNbN) was observed only in AES. M23C6, Z-phase and G-phase were characterized in XRD. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using ThermoCalc Version S, with the TCS Steel and Fe-alloys Database (TCFE6), and Thermotech Ni-based Superalloys Database (TTNI8) were validated by comparing experimental phase fraction results obtained from both EPMA and AES. A computational study looking at variations in the chemical composition of the alloy, and how they affect phase equilibria, was investigated. Increasing the nitrogen concentration is shown to decrease G-phase formation, where it is replaced by other intermetallic phases such as Z-phase and π-phase that do not experience liquation during pre-weld annealing treatments. Suppressing G-phase formation was ultimately determined to be a function of minimizing silicon content, and understabilizing the Nb/(C + 6/7N) ratio.},

Instability of NbC between 700 and 1000°C occurs in these alloys, with partial transformation to a nickel-niobium silicide, G phase. A time-temperature-transformation diagram has been constructed for the 1.97\% Nb alloy. Creep tests were made on the as-cast and aged material. Niobium containing alloys aged at 700 and 900°C display superior creep properties to those of the as-cast material or material aged at 1100°C.

The model describes a thermal crack susceptible region in the HAZ in which liquation cracking may occur. This thermal crack susceptible region is material-specific and represents a true quantification of weldability. The development of this model has provided a quantitative methodology for predicting HAZ liquation cracking susceptibility, elucidated the physical relationship between weldability test results, liquation cracking theories and material properties, and clarified the interpretation of test data from the hot-ductility, the spot-and longitudinal-Varestraint tests. This paper discusses how the model is obtained and addresses the methodologies of data interpretation of the three tests. The conventional methods of data interpretation are also critically reviewed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism of weld cracking in the HAZ of long-term aged HP heat-resistant cast steel containing Nb, Mo, and W during repair. The results obtained may be summarised as follows: The results obtained in butt welding cracking tests using as-cast specimens and aged specimens (aged for 247 Msec) suggest that ductility-dip cracking occurs in the HAZ of the aged specimens and that this cracking mainly propagates through the microconstituents precipitated at the dendrite grain boundaries. The results obtained in the elevated temperature high-speed tensile tests of aged specimens and as-cast specimens in the temperature range 673–1473 K suggest that the aged specimens sustain an especially heavy loss of ductility in the temperature range below 773 K. The results obtained in the elevated temperature high-speed tensile tests and small-sized U-groove restraint cracking tests at 773 K using aged specimens and specimens aged at 1323 K suggest that the hot ductility of the base metal strongly affects the weld cracking susceptibility. The results obtained in the investigations of identification of the microconstituents in specimens aged at 1323 K and the changes in their deformation suggest that, among the eutectic NbC microconstituent and massive M7C3 microconstituent found in the as-cast specimens, the M7C3 changes into M23C6 and the eutectic NbC changes into theη phase (Nb3Ni2Si) as a new microconstituent under long-term ageing. These microconstituents are simultaneously formed in a network-like pattern at the dendrite grain boundaries. The weld cracking affecting the aged specimens is considered to be due to the fact that the deformation of the dendrite grains is restrained by the microconstituents covering the dendrite grain boundaries in a network-like pattern, that the dendrite matrix has a reduced deformability, and notably that cracking is initiated from the more cracking-prone η phase to propagate through the M23C6.},

  abstract = {The solidification behavior and fusion zone solidification cracking response of Alloy 20Cb-3 was investi- gated by Varestraint testing, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and microstruc- tural characterization techniques includ- ing  light  optical  microscopy  (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Autogenous 20Cb-3 welds were evalu- ated, along with composite fusion zones prepared with 20Cb-3 base metal and INCO 112 filler metal. The 20Cb-3 alloy initiated solidification by a primary L ? ? reaction and completed solidification at \textasciitilde{}1300°C (2372°F) by a eutectic-type L ? (? + NbC) transformation. The composite 20Cb-3/INCO 112 fusion zone also ex- hibited the primary L ? ? and eutectic- type  L  ? (? +  NbC)  reactions,  but solidification  did  not  terminate  until 1223°C  (2233.4°F), with  a  second eutectic-type reaction consisting of L ? (? + Laves). The solidification paths of each fusion zone composition were cal- culated and plotted on a ?-Nb-C pseudo- ternary liquidus projection as an aid to understanding  the  influence  of  alloy composition on the progression of solid- ification transformations, and the pre- dicted results were in good agreement with  the  experimentally  determined solidification reaction sequences. Both the autogenous 20Cb-3 and composite 20Cb-3/INCO 112 fusion zones exhib- ited  a  higher  degree  of  solidification cracking susceptibility than 304 stainless steel. The 20Cb-3/INCO 112 composite fusion zone displayed the highest crack- ing  propensity.  A  recently  developed model was utilized to calculate the vari- ation  in  fraction  liquid  with  distance within the crack-susceptible solid + liq- uid (mushy) zone for each fusion zone composition. The modeling results di- rectly showed that the presence of the low temperature L ? (? + Laves) reaction in the 20Cb-3/INCO 112 fusion zone extended the mushy zone out to large distances, thus accounting for the higher crack lengths observed in this composite fusion zone sample during Varestraint testing. These results were used to un- derstand  the  relation  between  fusion zone composition, solidification behav- ior and the resultant solidification crack- ing response.},

  abstract = {Fully austenitic materials, such as nickel base alloys and several stainless steels, can be prone to hot cracking in the heat affected zone during welding. Such cracks, due to their small size commonly denoted as micro-cracks, were found in laser hybrid welds of a high nitrogen stainless steel (UNS S 34565 / German material no. 1.4565). Mechanical testing, such as tensile and Charpy V-notch tests as well as cyclic loading, has been carried out on hot crack afflicted laser plasma hybrid welds. The test results show that the ductility of the material is decreased, whereas the strength is not influenced at all. SEM micrographs of the fracture surfaces revealed that micro-cracks in the HAZ were associated with failure. For a thorough evaluation of the cracking mechanism, the orientation of the micro-cracks alongside the fusion line of the hybrid welds is of great importance. Thus, computer tomography using micro focus X-ray has been carried out. Using this new approach, the orientation of the cracks towards the fusion boundary was ascertained. It turned out that the critical strain emerged at specific sites of the hybrid weld. The critical strain was oriented tangentially to the fusion boundary and perpendicularly to the welding direction. X-ray cone beam computer tomography turned out as a very useful tool for the investigation of the crack distribution and hence, for getting qualitative information about the critical stress/strain distribution in real welds.},

  abstract = {Models of varying complexity are available for understanding the role of composition on the solidification behavior of engineering alloys. The choice of an appropriate model is dictated by the solidification behavior of the alloy. In some situations, seemingly complex alloys can be represented accurately using simple binary models when only one eutectic reaction occurs during solidification. In contrast, some alloys form two or more eutectic constituents during solidification and require the use of ternary or multicomponent models. In this article, several examples are given on the use of binary, ternary, and multicomponent solidification models for understanding and controlling the solidification behavior and resultant microstructure of engineering alloys of practical interest. Examples are applied to Ni-Cr-Mo-Gd alloys currently under development for spent nuclear fuel applications; a nickel base superalloy (IN718); and dissimilar welds between a super austenitic stainless steel (CN3MN) and nickel alloy filler metal (IN686). Examples are also provided on applying the results of the solidification models for understanding and controlling the hot cracking response of the alloys.},

  abstract = {Reasons for hot cracking formation are frequently present. Metallurgical aspects represent only one conceivable contingency. Some years after the active period there is time to clear up the writing desk. It is amazing and interesting how many unanswered and unclear cases exist. Some of them are worth to be reflected again. Four of them will be presented in this contribution: 1. What sort of influence on hot cracking is created by the welder himself? 2. Hot cracking occurs in a material which normally is hot crack-proof. What is the reason? 3. Is it possilble to weld an extremly hot crack-sensitive material nearly without hot cracks? 4. What is the reason for hot cracking in the heat affected zone of the base material?},

  abstract = {The term \&quot;weldability\&quot; can be used to describe a wide variety of material characteristics when a material is subjected to welding. These may include the physical and mechanical properties of the material, the ease with which welding can be accomplished from a practitioner's standpoint, or the ability of the material to avoid metallurgical degradation, usually assessed by its susceptibility to cracking during welding or subsequent heat treatment. A number of weldability tests have been developed over the years to evaluate and quantify material weldability. Many of these test techniques have focused on the phenomenon known as "hot cracking". This paper will review the basic concepts associated with hot cracking and other forms of elevated temperature cracking associated with welds and describe some recent advances in the use of testing approaches to quantify susceptibility to these forms of cracking. This description will include the use of the Varestraint test, the cast pin tear test, and the Gleeble1 thermo-mechanical simulator for quantifying cracking susceptibility and providing comparative measures of weldability among alloys.},

  abstract = {The hot cracking behaviour of extra high-purity stainless steels was investigated with respect to type 310 stainless steel with various amounts of minor and impurity elements such as C, P, S and Mn. The purity of the type 310 stainless steels used was enhanced in the order of Type 310\ensuremath{<}Type 310S\ensuremath{<}Type 310ULC\ensuremath{<}Type 310EHP steels. The hot cracking susceptibility was evaluated by the transverse-Varestraint test. This test revealed that two types of hot cracks occurred in these steels; solidification and ductility-dip cracks. The solidification cracking susceptibility was significantly reduced as the amount of C, P and S decreased, and that Type 310EHP steel reached a level so low that solidification cracking did not occur in practical welding. On the other hand, the ductility-dip cracking susceptibility adversely increased as the purity of the steels was enhanced. However, the ductility-dip cracking susceptibility of Type 310EHP steel was sufficiently as low as not to yield ductility-dip cracking in practical welding. Numerical analysis suggested that the reduced solidification cracking susceptibility upon refining C, P and S could be attributed to the reduced solidification brittle temperature range due to the suppression of solidification segregation of minor and impurity elements. The quantitative contribution of minor and impurity elements to the hot cracking susceptibility of extra high-purity type 310 stainless steels was evaluated by using lab-melted steels with different amounts of C, P, S and Mn. The essential influence on solidification cracking was the ratio of P:S:C=1:1.3:0.5, while Mn negligibly ameliorated solidification cracking in the extra low S (and P) steels. On the other hand, a molecular orbital analysis to estimate the binding strength of the grain boundary suggested that the increased ductility-dip cracking susceptibility in extra high-purity steels was caused by grain boundary embrittlement due to the refining of beneficial elements for grain boundary strengthening such as C.},

  abstract = {A new methodology for quantifying heat-affected zone (HAZ) liquation cracking susceptibility has been developed by considering the temperature-dependent, hot ductility of a material during welding in the context of current liquation cracking theories. This methodology defines a temperature field in the HAZ surrounding the weld pool, termed the thermal crack susceptible region (CSR) in which liquation cracking may occur. The thermal CSR is material-specific and represents a metallurgically-based quantification of weldability. Using this method, weldability test results can be more easily applied to actual welding conditions. This paper describes how this methodology can be utilized in conjunction with three widely used weldability testing techniques, namely, the Gleeble hot ductility test, and the spot and longitudinal type Varestraint tests. The method of data interpretation is addressed for each test technique and correlations among test techniques described.},

Hot cracks were localized at liquated HAZ grain boundaries adjacent to the fusion line. Microprobe analysis of liquated, crack-susceptible boundaries revealed a 50-fold increase in titanium concentration relative to the bulk composition. A Ti-rich Laves phase, which exhibits a melting point approximately 50 degree C (122 degree F) below the bulk solidus temperature, was associated with the liquated boundary region. A mechanism involving the dissolution of Ti-rich carbides and assimilation of the titanium into migrating HAZ grain boundaries has been proposed to explain the HAZ hot cracking phenomenon. Both the nature and distribution of carbides (or carbonitrides) in the base metal microstructure were found to have a profound effect on the hot cracking behavior of alloy 800.},

A parametric equation tgακ based on the simulation test results is also proposed. Thanks to a vacuum chamber of the Thermorestor-W simulator, the fracture surfaces of liquation cracks are suitable for further study of metallurgical cracking. Examples of low melting eutectic phases revealed by microfractographic analysis are shown. The validity of calculation indices and the preliminary test criteria of liquation cracking have to be further verified with the results obtained on real joints.},

  abstract = {Hot cracks appear when thermal shrinkage together with deformation caused by restraint cannot be accommodated by plastic deformation. This happens during welding to such alloys, which segregate on heating and cooling at near-solidus temperatures, in particular when low-melting and mechanically weak phases form and occur over a wide range of temperatures. To check for susceptibility to the liquation cracking caused by the low-melting, weak phases, hot tensile testing can be used in combination with a thermal cycle resembling that of real welding. This procedure, which can be executed on a GleebleTM1 thermal-mechanical simulator, comprises tensile testing of a number of cylindrical samples at the temperatures below solidus and determining their hot strength and ductility. For measuring of the brittle temperature range (BTR), the nil strength temperature (NST) is determined and used as the peak point, down from which the ductility recovery temperature (DRT) is searched for. The ductility is measured after the tensile test as a reduction in area at fracture. An alternative to the hot tensile test during the simulated welding cycle is the straininduced crack opening (SICO) test, in which a rod-like sample mounted in "cold" copper jaws of the Gleeble is heated by electric current and then compressed till formation of a bulge in its uniformly heated central portion and appearance of cracks due to secondary tensile strain developed along the maximum perimeter of this bulge. Next to the studies of liquation cracking and ductility-dip cracking of the reheat-type, the Gleeble procedures can be also used to determine sensitivity to solidification cracking and for this the samples are melted and solidified in a controlled manner before the hot tensile testing or the SICO testing. The developed routines of the Gleeble testing allow accurate determination of temperatures at which the cracks occur as well as measurement of critical strains to fracture and strain rates which are associated with the hot cracking. At an appropriate geometry of samples and optimum setting of the experiments, the hot cracks generated in the samples have sizes comparable to those that occur in heat-affected zones of real welds or in weld metals.},

Theoretical arguments are presented to show that the diffusion path cannot be a straight line connecting the terminal compositions. Experimental results indicate the existence of the NbC-γ diffusion couple and also support the hypothesis that the diffusion path is not a straight line connecting NbC and γ. Consequently, the temperature at which carbide liquation can occur is below the equilibrium NbC solidus, and hence, carbide liquation is constitutional in nature. The lowest temperature at which carbide liquation initiates depends upon the extent of deviation of the diffusion path from the straight line path. The dependence of the relative volume fractions of carbide and Laves phase in cast alloys on Nb/C ratio is explained using the γ-NbC-Laves pseudo-ternary. The Laves phase present in cast alloys is shown to liquate at the terminal eutectic temperature of the alloy, which could be lower than the carbide liquation temperature.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews some of the kinetic aspects of second phase dissolution in binary and multicomponent systems, and relates them to the phenomenon of constitutional liquation, which is one of the causes of liquation in the subsolidus portion of the weld heat affected zone (HAZ) of these alloys. Particular attention is devoted to the concept of interface control during precipitate dissolution, and its effect on the extent and kinetics of constitutional liquation. It is shown that the presence of a sluggish interfacial reaction during precipitate dissolution has the potential to completely eliminate subsolidus liquation in the HAZ. Some of the conditions under which precipitate dissolution might become interface controlled are discussed. It is proposed that some of these variables can be controlled either through proper alloy design or through appropriate heat treatments, in order to develop microstructures which resist liquation in the subsolidus HAZ.},

  abstract = {The melting and solidification behavior of Alloy 625 has been investigated with differential thermal analysis (DTA) and electron microscopy. A two-level full-factorial set of chemistries involving the elements Nb, C, and Si was studied. DTA results revealed that all alloying additions decreased the liquidus and solidus temperatures and also increased the melting temperature range. Terminal solidification reactions were observed in the Nb-bearing alloys. Solidification microstructures in gastungsten-arc welds were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. All alloys solidified to an austenitic (γ) matrix. The Nb-bearing alloys terminated solidification by forming various combinations of γ/MC(NbC), γ/Laves, and γ/M6C eutectic-like constituents. Carbon additions (0.035 wt pct) promoted the formation of the γ/MC(NbC) constituent at the expense of the γ/Laves constituent. Silicon (0.4 wt pct) increased the formation of the yJLaves constituent and promoted formation of the γ/M6C carbide constituent at low levels (\ensuremath{<}0.01 wt pct) of carbon. When both Si (0.4 wt pct) and C (0.035 wt pct) were present, the γ/MC(NbC) and γ/Laves constituents were observed. Regression analysis was used to develop equations for the liquidus and solidus temperatures as functions of alloy composition. Partial derivatives of these equations taken with respect to the alloying variables (Nb, C, Si) yielded the liquidus and solidus slopes t(m L , m S ) for these elements in the multicomponent system. Ratios of these liquidus to solidus slopes gave estimates of the distribution coefficients (k) for these same elements in Alloy 625.},

  abstract = {The ability of NbC and Laves phases to promote intergranular liquation cracking in the weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) of cast alloy 718 is examined in this paper. The term liquation cracking as used in this paper is synonymous with the terms microfissuring and hot cracking as used by the authors in previous papers. Many alloys are susceptible to intergranular liquation cracking due to the formation of incipient intergranular liquid films which can open into intergranular cracks. Previous studies on alloy 718 showed that both NbC and Laves phases produce intergranular liquid films when subjected to the rapid thermal cycles of the HAZ. When seeking a correlation between microstructure and liquation cracking, it is thus necessary to account for changes in the volume fractions and distributions of both NbC and Laves phases. The volume fractions and distributions of NbC and Laves phases were varied by heat treatment and also by using two bulk carbon concentrations. Increasing the bulk carbon from 0.02 to 0.06 wt pct caused a 70 pct increase in the volume fraction of NbC but no significant change in the amount of Laves phase. This increase in NbC was accompanied by an 18 pct increase in liquation cracking in the as-cast metal as measured using the spot varestraint test. When the volume fraction of NbC and Laves phases were varied using heat treatment, a very different behavior was observed. One hour heat treatments at 1200°F (649°C) and 1700°F (927 °C) reduced the amount of NbC by 40 pct, and the 1200°F (649°C) treatment also reduced the volume of Laves phase. Surprisingly, although the 1200°F (649°C) treatment reduced the amounts of both Laves phase and NbC, it produced a 23 pct increase in liquation cracking, while the 1700°F (927°C) treatment produced an opposite 22 pct decrease in liquation cracking. The effect of carbon content on the as-cast liquation cracking susceptibility is discussed in terms of its effect on the volume fraction of liquid produced during the welding thermal cycle and the subsequent resolidification kinetics of the liquid during cooling. The effects of different heat treatments are discussed in terms of their ability to redistribute solute, impurities, and precipitates within the matrix and to grain boundaries in deleterious or beneficial ways.},

  abstract = {Duplex stainless steels (DSS) are alloys made of ferrite and austenite, with a proportion of each phase around 50\%. Their main advantage in comparison with other austenitic and ferritic stainless steels is the attractive combination of high strength and corrosion resistance together with good formability and weldability. Unfortunately, DSS often present a poor hot workability. This phenomenon can stem from different factors associated to the balance of the phases, the nature of the interface, the distribution, size and shape of the second phase, and possibly also from difference in rheology between ferrite and austenite. In order to determine the specific influence of phase morphology on the hot-workability of DSS, two austenite morphologies (E: Equiaxed and W: Widmanstatten) with very similar phase ratio have been generated using appropriate heat treatments. It was checked that the latter treatments generate stable microstructures so that subsequent hot mechanical tests are performed on the microstructures of interest. One microstructure consists of a ferritic matrix with austenitic equiaxed islands while the other microstructure is composed of a ferritic matrix with Widmanstatten austenite. The latter morphology corresponds to the morphology observed in as-cast slabs.},

Materials evaluated include Waspaloy and Alloy 718. Samples are initially given an elevated temperature thermal exposure that simulates the weld HAZ. Upon cooling from elevated temperature, the sample is loaded such that yield strength magnitude stresses are present at room temperature. The sample is then heated to a selected PWHT temperature and held for up to 8 hours. Hot ductility tests were performed at various PWHT temperatures and times. From the reduction in area measurements a mathematical model was developed to relate ductility to PWHT temperature and time. The alloys tested show a significant dip in ductility at elevated temperature. Waspaloy samples exhibited lower ductility at elevated temperatures than did Alloy 718. Minimum ductility samples revealed ductile intergranular fracture paths in Waspaloy and an increased tendency for transgranular failure in Alloy 718. Grain size was shown to effect ductility and fracture mode.},

This paper reports on the effectiveness of three back-propagation artificial neural network models that predict (i) the impact toughness of quenched and tempered pressure vessel steel exposed to multiple postweld heat treatment (PWHT) cycles, (ii) the hardness of the simulated heat affected zone in pipeline and tap fitting steels after in-service welding and (iii) the hot ductility and hot strength of various microalloyed steels over the temperature range for strand or slab straightening in the continuous casting process. Predicted and actual experimental values for each model are well matched and highlight the success of applying ANNs in predicting mechanical properties. The capability of ANNs in predicting multiple outputs (hot ductility and hot strength) is also demonstrated.

The sensitivity, which is a measure of the response of an output across the range of an individual input variable, of key input variables (individual alloys and/or process steps) for each model is shown to be in agreement with findings of both the experimental investigation and reports in the literature. Although this paper shows that ANNs can be employed for optimizing steel and process design parameters, some difficulty can arise when inter-relationships exist between input variables. An understanding of the inter-relationships between input variables is essential for interpreting the sensitivity data and optimizing design parameters. It is argued that artificial neural network models can be developed that have the capacity to eliminate the need for expensive experimental investigation in areas, such as welding (new and repair), inspection and testing, and manufacturing processes.},

Microstructural analyses were performed by optical metallography, fractography, electron microprobe analysis, and analytical electron microscopy on specimens that were water quenched from selected temperatures during this thermal cycle. Analysis of analytical electron microscopy (AEM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) data suggests that incipient melting of the grain boundaries occurs at temperatures of 1300 °C and above. The HAZ hot-cracking mechanism was consistent with aspects of a constitutional liquation phenomenon involving a nonequilibrium eutectic-type reaction between grain boundary Ti(C, N) and the austenitic matrix. The extent of expected HAZ cracking would be low as the liquation of Ti(C, N) was localized and no lower melting intermetallic solidification products(e.g., Laves) were observed. The mechanistic observations were consistent with classical thermodynamic and solid state diffusion models.},

In wholly austenitic materials a low liquation temperature leads to poor hot ductility. The liquation temperature of the steel was determined to be a function of its columbium, carbon, and nitrogen contents. When ferrite is present in the steel, poor hot ductility can also occur as a result of the crack sensitivity of the two-phased structure.},

Three heat treatments were studied using the Gleeble hot ductility test. A modified hot ductility test was also used to follow the evolution of microstructure during simulated welding thermal cycles. The microstructural evolution was correlated with the hot ductility data in order to evaluate the mechanism of hot cracking in alloy 718. The correlation of hot ductility with microstructure showed that recrystallization, grain growth, and dissolution of precipitates did not in themselves cause any loss of ductility during cooling. Ductility loss during cooling was not initiated until the constitutional liquation of NbC particles was observed in the microstructure. Laves-type phases were found precipitated in the solidified grain boundaries but were not found to correlate with any ductility loss parameter. Mechanisms are reviewed which help to explain how heat treatment controls the hot crack susceptibility of alloy 718 as measured in the hot ductility test.},

  abstract = {Duplex austenite–ferrite stainless steels are susceptible to a variety of decomposition processes when aged within the intermediate range of temperatures (250–500 °C). One of these phenomena is the precipitation of the intermetallic G-phase. In the present investigation, the crystal structure and the chemical composition of the G-phase, precipitated in the ferritic phase of an AISI329 duplex stainless steel, is studied by electron microdiffraction and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It is determined that the space group of the G-phase is F 3 with a lattice parameter four times that of the ferritic matrix. The precipitation mechanism of the G-phase showed a synergetic relation with the ferrite decomposition in Cr-rich and Fe-rich domains. Based on the obtained results, the structural proximity of ferrite matrix and G-phase has been studied. Further analysis allows to suggest that the spinodal decomposition leads to an interdomain of a ferritic structure which is thermodynamically unstable and serves as a precursory site to the development of the G-phase by atomic position readjustments inferior to the atomic distances.},

  abstract = {Repair  welding  of aged Ni-Cr castings  used  in  high  temperature  petroleum  refining  applications  is  often  disrupted  by  liquation cracking in  the  heat  affected  zone  (HAZ).  The  only  accepted  method  for  avoiding  the  problem  is  a  high  temperature  sol uti on anneal (1190°C) before welding, which is difficult to accomplish in field repairs.  Analysis  of grain  boundary  constituents in  several  aged  casting  alloys  has  shown  that  nickel and silicon diffuse to the niobium carbide boundary and then into the carbide itself  as  aging progresses.  This leads to low melting point phases of undetermined chemistry,  which  cause  the  liquation  cracking  during  welding.  There  is  no  direct  evidence  of G  phase  formation,  but  the  diffusion-affected  carbides  have  several  possible  eutectic  relationships which form liquids below 1200°C with compositions similar to the G phase  composition. Solution annealing appears to reverse the diffusion of the segregated nickel  and silicon, leaving the niobium carbide in an unaged state with good weldability.  Co-segregation of interstitial elements such as phosphorous and  sulphur was not  observed.  An apparent  concentration of phosphorous  in  the  aged  niobium  carbide  was  traced  peak  overlap  in  to  the  similar  X-ray  spectra  generated  by  niobium  and  phosphorous in the  energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).  Molybdenum and  sulphur  often appear for the same reason, even when Mo is absent and sulphur segregation is not  occurring in the alloy.},

The initial part of this investigation has focused on characterization of the microstructure of these alloys after service exposure times of up to 12~years. Microstructure evolution from the as-cast condition to the service-exposed condition is described. In the as-cast condition, both eutectic NbC and Cr-rich M7C3 carbides were observed in the HP–Nb alloys. In contrast, only eutectic NbC carbides were present in the as-cast 20–32Nb alloys due to a significantly higher atomic ratio of Nb/C as compared to the HP–Nb alloys. In the service-exposed condition, an Ni–Nb silicide and Cr-rich M23C6 were identified in both alloys. The HP–Nb alloys exhibited a much higher total volume fraction of microconstituents than the 20–32Nb alloys and the M23C6 phase was more prevalent than Ni–Nb silicide. In contrast, the Ni–Nb silicide was dominant in the service-exposed 20–32Nb alloys. This difference resulted in a significant increase in the repair welding liquation cracking susceptibility of the 20–32Nb service-exposed alloy.},

In addition, a Si-rich intermetallic compound formed on the MC carbides along the grain boundaries in the cast alloy which had been in service around 760\&\#xa0;°C for about 4 years. The Si-rich phase was identified as G-phase by the experimental and simulated TEM diffraction patterns. EDX of TEM revealed that its molecular formula is Nb6 (Ni,Fe)16 (Si,Cr)7.},

In this paper, the properties of 12 solid-solution-strengthened and six age-hardenable heat-resistant alloys are compared. Weldability is an important attribute and can be a major limiting factor in the use of certain alloys. Weldability test methods are discussed, and the resistance of alloys to solidification cracking and strain-age cracking is compared. The use of weldability testing in the development of modern heat-resistant alloys is discussed with several examples cited. Finally, alloy selection for gas turbine components is outlined, taking into account both alloy properties and fabricability.},

Starting with conventionally cast test melts, a processing route, known as diffusion alloying, was used to achieve a fine dispersion of the NbC. Two different alloys were used to reveal the influence of nickel and cobalt on the system. The resulting properties led to the choice of the alloy containing cobalt for industrial production. The complex processing route was continuously optimised for this purpose. In addition, the heat treatment was adjusted to simultaneously achieve a high hardness and a high corrosion resistance. The promising laboratory results led to the manufacture of bearings, which were investigated in bearing lifetime tests to estimate their usability for applications in seawater.},

At a meeting held at Battelle's Columbus, Ohio, laboratories, D. B. Roach told representatives of 24 firms involved in various aspects of steam reforming that, though production of hydrogen through steam reforming has been a highly successful process, "increased plant size and more severe operating conditions have given rise to serious problems." "Although materials do exist," Mr. Roach continues, "that will withstand temperatures of 1700° F. and pressures of 300 p.s.i., their limitations are not fully known." Many costly plant failures have resulted, the Battelle scientist adds. Mr. Roach, who is scheduled to be program manager of the proposed research study, says that failures in the primary reformer system involving components such as the catalyst tubes, headers, and transfer lines have been particularly troublesome to reformer furnace operators. ...},

The aged microstructures contained secondary precipitates at both the periphery of the eutectic niobium carbides and at intradendritic locations. Chemical analysis indicated the precipitates were M2306 chromium carbides and intermetallic niobium-nickel-silicides. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis indicated the niobium-nickel-silicides were predominately G-phase (Ni16Nb6Si7) as well as q'-phase (Nb3Ni2Si). The niobium-nickel-silicides significantly reduced the mechanical properties of the material at room and operating temperatures. The precipitated intermetallic silicides are expected to decrease the creep resistance of the cast material. Previous analysis found the niobium-nickel-silicides also promoted liquation cracking upon welding in the aged condition. The analysis results suggest the nominal chemistry of the alloy should be modified to inhibit precipitation of the detrimental intermetatlic niobium-nickel- silicides upon aging at elevated temperatures.},

This section on fabrication is derived largely from the technology of superalloy component manufacture. Much of the technology is transferrable to other materials and it seems likely that over the next decade much R and D in industry will be devoted to doing just that. Not everything is readily adapted. For example titanium is chemically extremely reactive and would pick up impurities from any crucible material. Both titanium and aluminium form impermeable oxide films making sintering of powder a very difficult process. Alloys currently favoured for HT Petrochemical processes are not readily formed either “cold or hot”. Nevertheless for all these and other HTMs there are some aspects of superalloy production which are being or could be adopted with benefit.},

However, there are particular characteristics of these two classes of material which severely restrict their range of application in terms of permissible operating parameters and these, if infringed, can lead to failures in service.

  abstract = {Testing Metrology is a generic name used to describe the combination of measurement techniques of sufficient accuracy necessary to determine materials property data. The appropriate accuracy is to some extent dependent upon the purpose for which the data is required, since the level of precision sufficient for product release may be inadequate for determining reliable design data for high technology plant operating in a hostile high temperature environment. Relatively simple product release tests, such as hardness, impact strength, tensile testing (RT and HT) or even the simple one hundred hour stress rupture test, do not provide the design engineer or the plant operator with the necessary data to safely design or predict remnant life of components. Sophisticated testing techniques, such as tests to provide multiaxial creep data, low cycle fatigue, with or without combined creep dwell cycles, or creep crack growth measurements are becoming more important. Despite an improved understanding of the behaviour of materials, in some circumstances it is still regarded as necessary to resort to model component testings (1) or to test full size samples for which testing nuclear containment pressure vessels has provided the impetus to develop 100 MN testing facilities - see Fig. 1 (2). This latter machine will be capable of testing specimens up to 2.5 m in width, under uni-axial or bi-axial stressing conditions, up to approximately 300°C. The specific subject of high temperature testing metrology has been promoted in the UK during the last few years by the activities of the High Temperature Mechanical Testing Committee, resulting in a number of publications covering a broad range of testing techniques (1, 3 to 7).},

The modified chemistry consisted of minimizing the niobium-to-carbon ratio and the silicon content and increasing the manganese content. Mechanical testing at room temperature and elevated temperature, high temperature creep rupture testing, and microstructural analyses were performed on material in the ascast condition as well as material aged from 10 to 10,000 hours at a constant temperature of 1472oF (800oC). Room temperature mechanical testing indicated that the aged tensile strength and aged ductility of the modified chemistry alloy was consistently superior to the standard chemistry alloy. Microstructural analysis indicated the tensile strength and ductility degradation of the standard chemistry material was directly correlated to the precipitation of a nickel-niobium-silicon rich phase. The chemistry modification mitigated precipitation of the detrimental nickel-niobium-silicon rich phase.},

Microstructural analyses were carried out using scanning microscopy, X-ray diffraction and quantitative microprobe analysis. Depending on chemical composition, the following phases have been identified: NbC, TiC, (Ti,Nb)C, M23C6, and Ni- and Si-rich phases (probably G phase). The presence of the Ni–Si-rich phases, found subsequent to the annealing process, appears to be closely associated with the presence of unstable carbide precipitates. Although additions of Ti and/or Nb improved the microstructure, mechanical properties of such modified alloys at temperatures of 20 and 900 °C were markedly lower in comparison to these modified separately by either of these two elements.},

The response of the tube to eddy current non-destructive testing was measured using the carburization crawler under development at Quest Integrity NZL Ltd. The matrix was significantly depleted of chromium, as low as 4 wt\% Cr at the inner wall. M23C6 carbides transformed to M7C3 at the inner wall region and NbC carbides partially transformed to the chromium-rich η-carbide at the outer wall region, both of which likely contributed to the chromium depletion of the matrix. The present results indicate that the NACE etchant attacks the austenitic matrix where chromium content is below approximately 12wt\%. A comparison to other ex-service tubes indicates that matrix chromium content and the location of the M23C6/M7C3 transformation front are useful microstructural characteristics for interpreting eddy current NDT response.},

These manifolds can be visualized as a high-temperature piping system that collects the reformed gas from the outlets of the catalyst tubes. The catalyst tube outlet usually is connected to the manifold by means of a flexible pigtail. The pigtail is connected to the manifold via welded fittings, and the components of the manifold assembly are connected by welded joints. These hot manifolds operate under internal pressures in the range of 2000 to 3500 kPa and at temperatures in the range of 800 to 900\&deg;C The components are typically made of wrought Alloy 800, 800H or 800HT or similar cast 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb alloys. The welds are made using filler metals or electrodes of similar compositions or high-nickel alloy compositions. Creep-rupture data that have been developed for weld metals are reviewed and compared. Problems that have been encountered with failures of welds in this application are discussed. The current recommended materials for welding these manifolds are outlined.

  abstract = {The steam methane reformer of RIL SEZ refinery was commissioned in 2009. Cold header replacement was planned in 2012, due to severe hot spots occurrences. While performing field welds at bull tee to cone material transitions, cracking was experienced when welding static cast tees (20Cr-32Ni-1Nb alloy) to hot header and reducers (cone). Cracks were reported in tees's heat-affected-zones. Specific weld repair procedures were developed. This paper discusses the in-service damaging mechanisms that apply to these headers including creep, thermal fatigue, thermal shock, metal dusting, thermal aging embrittlement and reheat cracking. This paper also discusses fabrication discontinuities such as solidification cracks, reheat cracks and ductility dip cracks. Then, the metallurgical analyses completed on the header components are discussed. Finally, the repairs are described including the learning steps that led to the final successful repair. The following sections of this paper depict how the innovative engineering solution was arrived at, analyzing the risks of continued operation, inspection, monitoring, and finalizing the strategy for on-line repair to sustain operation.

  abstract = {A majority of steam-methane reformers (SMRs) have hot outlet manifold systems that operate at temperatures in the range of 750 to 900 °C (1382 to 1652 °F) and internal pressures in the range of 2000 to 3500 kPag (290 to 510 psig). Under these operating conditions, the materials used in the manifold systems, including weld joints, are subject to degradation from high-temperature creep. Thus, fitness-for-service (FFS) assessment of the manifold systems requires evaluation of material degradation as a result of creep damage (voids, micro-fissures and cracks) and creep deformation (strain). This paper reviews a general approach to FFS assessment of SMR hot outlet manifold systems. Using data on operating temperature, pressure, and time in service stresses and strains in the manifold sections are calculated by the finite-element method. The calculated stress-strain data are then used to compute creep damage accumulation as a function of time in service for both base metal and weld joints using available creep-rupture data for the materials. These results are then used to predict remaining creep life and establish recommended inspection protocols.},

  abstract = {The steam methane reformer of RIL SEZ refinery was commissioned in 2009. Cold header replacement was planned in 2012, due to severe hot spots occurrences. While performing field welds at bull tee to cone material transitions, cracking was experienced when welding static cast tees (20Cr-32Ni-1Nb alloy) to hot header and reducers (cone). Cracks were reported in tees’s heat-affected-zones. Specific weld repair procedures were developed.This paper discusses the in-service damaging mechanisms that apply to these headers including creep, thermal fatigue, thermal shock, metal dusting, thermal aging embrittlement and reheat cracking. This paper also discusses fabrication discontinuities such as solidification cracks, reheat cracks and ductility dip cracks. Then, the metallurgical analyses completed on the header components are discussed.Finally, the repairs are described including the learning steps that led to the final successful repair. The following sections of this paper depict how the innovative engineering solution was arrived at, analyzing the risks of continued operation, inspection, monitoring, and finalizing the strategy for on-line repair to sustain operation.},
