\subsection{Characteristics of a Weldability Test}

\subsection{The Hot Ductility Test}
The origin of the hot ductility test can be traced back to work performed by \citet{nippes_cooling_1949} on the measurement of the actual time-temperature history (“thermal cycle”) experienced in the \gls{haz} of various alloys during welding.  Using this data as a foundation, they developed a machine, the “Gleeble,” capable of reproducing a given thermal cycle by resistively heating a sample and controlling the temperature as a function of time using an attached thermocouple \cite{nippes_development_1949}. This technique enabled the duplication of a specific region of the \gls{haz} in a macroscopically-sized sample suitable for mechanical testing.  The capabilities of the machine were expanded by adding a loading system which permitted the sample to be deformed or fractured at any point in the thermal cycle.  This capability of the Gleeble was put to use in the development of the hot ductility test \cite{nippes_investigation_1955}, in which the ductility of a particular alloy (in terms of percent reduction in cross-sectional area) is determined at various time-temperature points in the thermal cycle.  The hot ductility is normally determined in two distinct modes: “on-heating” and “on-cooling.”  Tests to determine “on-heating” hot ductility are performed during the initial portion of the thermal cycle where the sample is heated rapidly toward the peak temperature (see Figure 1a).  On-heating tests are typically performed at sequentially higher temperatures approaching the calculated \gls{haz} peak temperature (usually in the vicinity of 2400\textdegree{}F) until a test temperature is reached where the measured on-heating ductility drops to zero (0\% RA).  This temperature is designated the \gls{zdt}.  Once the \gls{zdt} has been determined, “on-cooling” hot ductility tests are performed in the portion of the thermal cycle where the sample temperature is decreasing after exposure to a peak temperature corresponding to the \gls{zdt} (see Figure 1b).  As will be discussed later, the measured on-cooling ductility behavior is considered the most indicative criteria of a material’s susceptibility to hot cracking.  Figure 2 shows schematic examples of the types of curves which can be constructed using the data obtained (\%RA vs. test temperature) from the on-heating and on-cooling hot ductility tests just described; important features of these curves are labeled in the plot and will be discussed in more detail in a following section. Further details regarding the history and development of the Gleeble, including references to other development papers not cited here and to research papers utilizing the Gleeble, can be found in the review articles by \citet{savage_apparatus_1962}, \citet{lundin_historical_1997}, and \citet{lundin_standardization_1990_history}. 

\subsection{Hot Ductility Evaluation Criteria}
In one of their early studies utilizing the Gleeble hot ductility test to evaluate a number of alloys, \citet{nippes_further_1957} classified the observed hot ductility responses of the various alloys into several categories, based on the shapes of the hot ductility curves: Classes H1 or H2 for the on-heating behavior and Classes C1, C2, or C3 for the on-cooling behavior. Schematic hot ductility curves illustrating the characteristics of each behavior class are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nippes-criteria} and a brief text description for each is provided in Table~\ref{tab:nippes-classification}. Of the two on-heating behavior categories, Class H2 (Figure~\ref{fig:nippes-criteria}b) behavior was identified as being intrinsically sensitive to hot cracking. Class H1 behavior (Figure~\ref{fig:nippes-criteria}a) was not considered in and of itself indicative of a propensity for hot cracking and thus required the evaluation of on-cooling results to determine the material's susceptibility. With regard to the on-cooling categories, materials exhibiting Class C1 (Figure~\ref{fig:nippes-criteria}c) behavior were considered not sensitive to hot cracking. Class C2 and Class C3 behaviors (Figure~\ref{fig:nippes-criteria}d,e) were associated with a higher sensitivity to hot cracking, with Class C3 behavior indicating the greatest sensitivity. In particular, \citeauthor{nippes_further_1957} found that those materials in the study which were known to exhibit hot cracking, based on field experience, exhibited Class C3 behavior with on-cooling ductility of 40\% or less of the on-heating ductility. Thus, using the Nippes classification system, in most cases a material's on-cooling ductility response will be the major indicating factor regarding its hot cracking susceptibility. Materials exhibiting Class C3 on-cooling behavior with a low recovery of on-cooling ductility (0--40\% of on-heating ductility) can be identified as showing the greatest susceptibility to hot cracking.

Further investigation of hot ductility test criteria was undertaken in a review by \citet{yeniscavich_correlation_1970}. One of the criteria reviewed, attributed to Nippes, was the \gls{drr}. According to this criteria, crack-resistant materials show a rapid recovery of on-cooling ductility after exposure to the \gls{haz} peak temperature, while the on-cooling ductility for crack-sensitive materials recovers slowly and remains low even at test temperatures well below the peak temperature. Schematic curves illustrating the \gls{drr} for crack-resistant and crack-sensitive materials are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:drr-schematic}. Numerically, the \gls{drr} is determined by taking the ratio of the on-cooling ductility to the on-heating ductility at a specified temperature, typically the rapid-ductility-decrease temperature on the on-heating curve (the point on the curve immediately prior to the sudden drop in ductility).

Yeniscavich also proposed the \gls{zdr} (also known as the \gls{ndr}) as an improved indicator of propensity for hot cracking. The \gls{zdr} phenomenon corresponds to a finite temperature increment below the \gls{zdt} in which the on-cooling ductility remains zero, i.e. the ductility does not immediately increase once the on-cooling test temperature is below the \gls{zdt}. The physical significance of the \gls{zdr} is related to the fact that the HAZ must possess sufficient ductility to withstand the thermal strains imposed during welding, otherwise cracking will occur. Since the magnitude of these strains is small over the length scale of an HAZ, the HAZ ductility must be on the order of zero for hot cracking to be of concern. Thus, alloys which show a large \gls{zdr} (zero ductility over a wide on-cooling temperature range) are considered more vulnerable to hot cracking than alloys which show a narrow \gls{zdr} (see Figure~\ref{fig:zdr-schematic}).
