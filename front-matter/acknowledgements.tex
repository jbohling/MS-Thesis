\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I owe special thanks to my major advisor, Dr. Carl Lundin, for his guidance and advice over the course of this project. I am also particularly thankful for my gracious and patient committee members, Dr. Hahn Choo and Dr. Carl McHargue. 

I am indebted to my fellow graduate students in the Materials Joining Group over the years, in particular D. Joshua Burgess, Max Trent, and Maneel Bharadwaj, for showing me the ropes and for our stimulating discussions on metallurgy and sundry topics. I am also grateful to the Materials Properties Council under the direction of Dr. Martin Prager and to the Center for Materials Processing, directed by Dr. Claudia Rawn through the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for providing funding to support this work.
