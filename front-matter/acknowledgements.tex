\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to especially thank my major advisor, Dr. Carl Lundin, for his guidance and advice over the course of this project. I am also particularly thankful for my gracious and patient committee members, Dr. Hahn Choo and Dr. Carl McHargue. 

I would like to thank my fellow graduate students in the Materials Joining Group over the years, in particular D. Joshua Burgess, Max Trent, and Maneel Bharadwaj, for sharing their knowledge and experience and for our stimulating discussions on metallurgy and other sundry topics. I am also grateful to the Materials Properties Council under the direction of Dr. Martin Prager and to the Center for Materials Processing, directed by Dr. Claudia Rawn through the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, for providing funding to support this work.
