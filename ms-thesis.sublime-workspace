These may include the physical and mechanical properties of the material, the ease with which welding can be accomplished from a practitioner's standpoint, or the ability of the material to avoid metallurgical degradation, usually assessed by its susceptibility to cracking during welding or subsequent heat treatment. A number of weldability tests have been developed over the years to evaluate and quantify material weldability. Many of these test techniques have focused on the phenomenon known as \"hot cracking\". This paper will review the basic concepts associated with hot cracking and other forms of elevated temperature cracking associated with welds and describe some recent advances in the use of testing approaches to quantify susceptibility to these forms of cracking. This description will include the use of the Varestraint test, the cast pin tear test, and the Gleeble1 thermo-mechanical simulator for quantifying cracking susceptibility and providing comparative measures of weldability among alloys.},\n  825    timestamp = {2016-01-18T15:39:43Z},\n  826    langid = {english},\n  ...\n  886  \n  887  @incollection{yakhushin_scientific_2005,\n  888:   title = {Scientific {{Bases}} of the {{International Standardization Project}} \"{{Hot Cracking Tests}} for {{Welds}}\"},\n  889    rights = {©2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},\n  890    isbn = {978-3-540-22332-0 978-3-540-27460-5},\n  ...\n  997    isbn = {978-3-540-22332-0 978-3-540-27460-5},\n  998    url = {http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-27460-X_18},\n  999:   abstract = {Hot cracks appear when thermal shrinkage together with deformation caused by restraint cannot be accommodated by plastic deformation. This happens during welding to such alloys, which segregate on heating and cooling at near-solidus temperatures, in particular when low-melting and mechanically weak phases form and occur over a wide range of temperatures. To check for susceptibility to the liquation cracking caused by the low-melting, weak phases, hot tensile testing can be used in combination with a thermal cycle resembling that of real welding. This procedure, which can be executed on a GleebleTM1 thermal-mechanical simulator, comprises tensile testing of a number of cylindrical samples at the temperatures below solidus and determining their hot strength and ductility. For measuring of the brittle temperature range (BTR), the nil strength temperature (NST) is determined and used as the peak point, down from which the ductility recovery temperature (DRT) is searched for. The ductility is measured after the tensile test as a reduction in area at fracture. An alternative to the hot tensile test during the simulated welding cycle is the straininduced crack opening (SICO) test, in which a rod-like sample mounted in \"cold\" copper jaws of the Gleeble is heated by electric current and then compressed till formation of a bulge in its uniformly heated central portion and appearance of cracks due to secondary tensile strain developed along the maximum perimeter of this bulge. Next to the studies of liquation cracking and ductility-dip cracking of the reheat-type, the Gleeble procedures can be also used to determine sensitivity to solidification cracking and for this the samples are melted and solidified in a controlled manner before the hot tensile testing or the SICO testing. The developed routines of the Gleeble testing allow accurate determination of temperatures at which the cracks occur as well as measurement of critical strains to fracture and strain rates which are associated with the hot cracking. At an appropriate geometry of samples and optimum setting of the experiments, the hot cracks generated in the samples have sizes comparable to those that occur in heat-affected zones of real welds or in weld metals.},\n 1000    timestamp = {2016-01-18T15:39:54Z},\n 1001    langid = {english},\n ....\n 1275  \n 1276  @online{_niobium_????,\n 1277:   title = {\"niobium in stainless steels\" pickering - {{Google Search}}},\n 1278    url = {https://www.google.com/search?q=niobium+in+stainless+steels&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=%22niobium+in+stainless+steels%22+pickering},\n 1279    timestamp = {2016-02-12T19:58:46Z},\n 1280    urldate = {2016-02-12},\n 1281:   file = {\"niobium in stainless steels\" pickering - Google Search:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\MJGroup\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Zotero\\\\Zotero\\\\Profiles\\\\ol2uaq08.default\\\\zotero\\\\storage\\\\TGCDBJWI\\\\search.html:}\n 1282  }\n 1283  \n ....\n 1602    url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cen-v047n002.p039},\n 1603    doi = {10.1021/cen-v047n002.p039},\n 1604:   abstract = {Battelle Memorial Institute has proposed a research program to determine what materials can satisfactorily withstand the severe operating conditions which exist in steam reformer furnaces.

Mr. Roach, who is scheduled to be program manager of the proposed research study, says that failures in the primary reformer system involving components such as the catalyst tubes, headers, and transfer lines have been particularly troublesome to reformer furnace operators. ...},\n 1605    timestamp = {2016-02-12T19:49:22Z},\n 1606    number = {2},\n\n18 matches across 2 files\n\n\nSearching 9 files for \"“\" (case sensitive)\n\nC:\\Users\\MJGroup\\Documents\\GitHub\\MS-Thesis\\chapters\\chapter-5.tex:\n  100  \\end{figure}\n  101  \n  102: Comparing the micrographs shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, it is apparent that the as-received Cone 1 and Cone 5 materials both exhibited a coarse dendritic microstructure with abundant intradendritic and interdendritic secondary phases.  Previous investigations (Hoffman and Colwell 1998; Hoffman and Gapinski 2001) of service-exposed 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb material with similar time in service indicated that the larger interdendritic phases were primarily niobium carbides (NbC), some of which were surrounded by a phase rich in Ni, Nb, and Si, while the intradendritic precipitates were determined to be mainly chromium carbides which precipitated as a result of service exposure.  The previously noted similarities in the hot ductility behavior are explained in light of the similarity of the as-received microstructures of the Cone 1 (“service-exposed”) and Cone 5 (“solution-annealed”) materials.  However, this was not the expected result based on the nominally reported material conditions since an earlier study on the repair weldability of 20Cr-32Ni-1Nb by Shi et al. (Shi, Lippold, and Ramirez 2010) indicated that solution annealed material showed a significantly different hot ductility response in terms of both on-heating and on-cooling behavior as compared to service-exposed material.  Therefore, the similar as-received microstructures of both Cone 1 and Cone 5, and the consequent similarities observed in the hot ductility characteristics, suggests that the weld joint region of Cone 5 (where the samples were extracted) was either not subjected to a solution annealing heat treatment or the parameters (temperature/time) were not adequate for an effective solution anneal, contrary to the information provided at the outset of this investigation.\n  103  \n  104  Regarding the Cone 5 On-Heating 2375°F (ZDT) hot ductility sample, examination of Figure 10a indicates that regions near the fracture surface showed a noticeably reduced extent of matrix precipitates compared a region remote from the fracture surface  (Figure 11).  This reduction is due to the dissolution of precipitates as a result of the high temperature exposure from the simulated thermal cycle.  It is also apparent from Figure 10a that the crack paths proceed along the interdendritic boundaries; Figure 10c and Figure 10d show that the crack faces appear to be associated with the interdendritic secondary phases.  Cracking proceeds along these boundaries because they are the regions corresponding to the greatest degree of solute segregation and resulting formation of low-melting point constituents; consequently, melting will begin at these regions first during the high temperatures imposed during the simulated thermal cycle of the hot ductility test.  The identity of the interdendritic phases has not yet been verified but this will be pursued as part of the future work.\n\n2 matches in 1 file\n",
